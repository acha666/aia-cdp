// CRL targets (plan §7.1): the upload POST /api/v1/crls hands one CRL, the raw request body, to
// publishCrl (src/core/publish.ts) and maps its result; GET /api/v1/crls is the target list of
// src/core/views.ts. Public routes, so this sub-app joins the AppType chain. The upload's format is
// recognized from the bytes. The list has one item per configured target (id = target UUID, never
// a store key), no pagination.
//
// The upload's route middleware, in this order: bearerAuth while AIA_UPLOAD_TOKEN is set (a
// missing or wrong token is 401 + WWW-Authenticate, a malformed Authorization header 400; unset,
// uploads need no token); the media type gate (415 with details); bodyLimit
// (AIA_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES, 413, also for a streamed body without Content-Length). So an anonymous
// client never gets its body read, nor a 413 that tells it the limit. Failures are thrown as
// ApiError / HTTPException (and, for the list, store errors): onError writes every envelope
// (no-store), and the handlers only return successes. HEAD of the list is Hono's automatic HEAD of
// its GET.
